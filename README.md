# PyDMBSI

This program provides a menu-based interface for interacting with an SQL database providing the user with the option to select an existing database or create a new one.

Once a database is selected, the user is presented with a menu of operations to perform on the database:

1. View Data
2. Add Data
3. Update Data
4. Delete Data

Depending on the user's selection, the script calls functions from other modules to perform the desired operation.

## Further Devlopment

PyDBMSI is still in active development. Additional features to be implemented will include:

1. Importing data from Web
2. Importing data from CSV
3. Exporting data to CSV
4. Sorting, aggregation and visualisation of data

## Installation

PyDBMSI requires Python 3.10+. Whilst PyDBMSI is still under development it can be installed via GitHub and ran with main.py

## Updates

<u>v.0.2.0</u>

Implemented functionality for importing tables from web. Still needs some optimisation however, it is functional.
